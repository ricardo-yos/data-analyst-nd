<strong>age</strong>: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

<strong>sibsp</strong>: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

<strong>parch</strong>: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
